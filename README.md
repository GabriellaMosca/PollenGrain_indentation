Ater completing the installation of MorphoMechanX, 
download this repo, open a terminal from within the repo, move to the sub-folder "pollen_oofs/oofs/ext/Pollen_Wedges" (i.e. type: "cd ./pollen_oofs/oofs/ext/Pollen_Wedges" )
From there, type:
"make clean"
"make run"
This will already load the model in the GUI and it will be ready to run. Follow the video tutorial attached to this repository to learn how to run and edit the model parameters.
