Info about the Pollen Grain Morphology 

major axis: 128,5 +-9,9 (pressurized)
minor axis: 98,3+-5,8   (pressurized)

intine/exine thinkess ratio ~ 3 (on the colpus might be higher, 3x more). intine 1.6 um, exine 0.5 um

Info about indentation on Pollen

indenter radius: less than 1 um (data we have: tip diameter less than 2 um)
indentation depth: various. about 0.9 um for exine and 1.9 um for intine. however, measurements were performed with a maximum force (10 uN) and not a maximum indentation depth.

what we detected:
ratio of apparent stiffness between intine and exine: 0.56 +- 0.1.
mean intine apparent stiffness is 9.3+-4.4 N/m
mean exine apparent stiffness 16.5+-6.6 N/m
however, both of them are not normally distributed. So using the value for intine and correlated to the exine through the ratio might be more applicable.

Material properties starting guess: 
Pressure 0.3 MPa? 
Youngs modulus pollen tube (intine) 90 MPa
